message: "Hi Bongi,\r\n\r\nIt's hard to tell without knowing the exact error, your partition scheme, when and how you got it. But what I'd do is to install GParted on Linux Mint. Then would create, and format partitions as necessary to install Windows. Find out if you're currently using BIOS or UEFI. Boot into your Windows installation media in the same boot mood. Then follow this article to recover Grub."
