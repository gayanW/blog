message: "Hi Gayan,\r\n\r\nI need your help. I have both Linux mint and Ubuntu installed on my system. I had Windows 8.1 before and I tried dual booting with Linux mint, I failed so I ended up with just Linux mint because i really wanted it. I installed Ubuntu later on, but I don't like it.\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that there are applications I need to use which only support windows. I want to reinstall windows 8.1 on the Ubuntu partition but I keep getting error 0xc000000f. I do not mind doing a clean install of windows and dual boot later, but I'm stuck with that error. Please help."
